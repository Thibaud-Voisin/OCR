Rosenblatt 1958 created the p501257erceptron an algorithm for
patt7687739ern recognition based on a two-layer learning
compu7147852ter network using simple addition an9630d
subtraction With mathematical notation Rosenblatt also described
circuitry not in the ba2876sic perceptron such as the exclusive-or
circuit 6876720653a circuit whose mathematical
compu7578107tation could not be processed until after the
backpropagation algorithm was created by Werbos 1975

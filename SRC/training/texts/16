Biophysical models such as BCM theory have been important in
understanding mechanisms for synaptic plasticity and have had
applications in both computer science and neuroscience Research is
ongoing in understanding the computational algorithms used in the brain
with some recent biological evidence for radial basis networks and
neural backpropagation as mechanisms for processing data

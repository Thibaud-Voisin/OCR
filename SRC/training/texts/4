Deep learning feedforward networks alternate convolutional layers
and max-pooling layers topped by several pure classification layers
Fast GPU based implementations of this approach have won
several pattern recognition contests including the IJCNN 2011
Traffic Sign Recognition Competition and the ISBI 2012
Segmentation of Neuronal Structures in Electron Microscopy Stacks
challenge Such neural networks also were the first artificial pattern
recognizers to achieve human-competitive or even superhuman
performance on benchmarks such as traffic sign recognition IJCNN
2012 or the MNIST handwritten digits problem of Yann LeCun and
colleagues at NYU
